Project analysis:
- Target use profile: The final user for this product will be someone who has interest in signing someone for a job, therefore
in this project what I did is give the essential information without having too much filler information.

- Information architecture: I think I tried to capture what was essential in my webpage without having too much information.
I tried to make it short so that you wouldn't get bored reading it, but informative so that after taking a look you could come
to a conclussion whether or not you are interested in me as an employee.

- Visual design: The inspiration that I had to do my webpage came from a couple of ideas I saw online. I decided to use 
a green color palette, just because I think it's a relaxing color that when someone open the webpage doesn't
get overwhelmed by the visauls, but rather makes them at ease.

Other information:

At the beggining of the project I wanted to make it for both phone and desktop users, however given that it
wasn't asked to do so and the problems that it was giving me, plus the little time I ended up having later on
I decided just to do it for desktop.

I wanted to add some JavaScript into the project by making it change part of the text in some fancy way, however
giving that I couldn't just get it to work and that I was losing too much time, I decided to give up on the idea
and just use a normal menu that would get you to the part of the page when you clicked on it instead of having
text appear and disappear when you clicked the menu.

The initial Figma design varies a little bit from what I ended up implementing, given that when I dessigned it,
I didn't really think that when the webpage gets opened in your local desktop it's much more bigger, so I had to
relocate some stuff so that it wouldn't have some empty spots. I also added a footer that it's not in the dessign
either.
